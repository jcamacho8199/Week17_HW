Tableau Assignment - Citi Bike Analytics

I conducted my analysis comparing the summer months (June thru September) year over year 2017-2018.
I captured data for these months from citibike's data center website.  Once all months files were downloaded, I used python to bring all files together and clean up the field names.  Once all data was cleansed, I created one file putting all data into one.

The entire analysis was done on Tableau.
